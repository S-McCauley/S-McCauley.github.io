Hey, look at this!  Blog entry number 1, I finally did it.

Originally the idea was to create a simple site to jot down ideas, track projects, and carve out a little piece of the internet to call my own so I think I'll start with that.

Personally I've always been somewhat of a writer. Maybe not in the formal sense but more of a semi-frequent journaler. There is still power in the printed word and the synapses that fire when trying to arrange words into something meaningful.  Even if no one were to read this, the fact that I can look back and say I created something is good enough for me.  Who knows, maybe these words will somehow survive the Giant Squid-Pocalypse of 2078 and future travelers discover them only to use them as a blueprint to fashion their own society filled with snark and shenanigans.

A man can dream.. 

Subjects I plan to focus on are things I enjoy in my day to day life and include:  cybersecurity, DevOps, Philosophy, Books, Projects, and anything else that interests me..  

Generally speaking I enjoy writing whenever I feel like it but to get this thing started and build a habit I'll try to post something every couple of weeks or so.
