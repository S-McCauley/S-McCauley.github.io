<p>Greetings, my name is Steve McCauley!  I’m currently a DevOps engineer, but my journey to this point is anything but conventional. For 10 years, I was a craft beer brewer and co-owner of a brewery I started with a couple of my close friends. It was an incredible experience, full of creativity and good times, but after a while, I realized I missed the world of technology.

From a young age I’ve always had a passion for computers, so as the party was ending for me in the brewing world, I decided it was time for a change. With the help of a loving wife, the most amazing mentors, a lot of self-learning and a shit ton of coffee, I made the leap into tech with reckless abandon.  Today in DevOps I’m able to blend my love of computers and learning while solving complex problems that I would never had dreamed of doing before.<p>

<p>I created this site to share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences as I traverse today's IT landscape.  Subjects will wander between video games, books, IT, cybersecurity, DevOps, the future, and philosophy to name a few.<p>
